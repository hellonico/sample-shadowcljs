Similar to the concept\n  of harmonics in physics, perlin noise is computed over several\n  octaves which are added together for the final result.\n\n  Another way to adjust the character of the resulting sequence is the\n  scale of the input coordinates. As the function works within an\n  infinite space the value of the coordinates doesn't matter as such,\n  only the distance between successive coordinates does (eg. when\n  using noise within a loop).

Only used in `:pdf` and `:svg`\n                        modes. Not supported in clojurescript. When writing to a\n                        file, call [[exit]] at the end of the draw call to end\n                        the sketch and not write repeatedly to the file.\n  * `:title`          - A string which will be displayed at the top of\n                        the sketch window. Not supported in clojurescript.\n  * `:features`       - A vector of keywords customizing sketch behaviour.\n                        Supported features:\n    - `:keep-on-top`   - Sketch window will always be above other windows.\n                         Note: some platforms might not support always-on-top windows.\n                         Not supported in clojurescript.\n    - `:exit-on-close` - Shutdown JVM  when sketch is closed.\n                         Not supported in clojurescript.\n    - `:resizable`     - Makes sketch resizable. Not supported in clojurescript.\n    - `:no-safe-fns`   - Do not catch and print exceptions thrown inside functions\n                         provided to sketch (like draw, [[mouse-click]],\n                         [[key-pressed]] and others). By default all exceptions\n                         thrown inside these functions are caught. This prevents\n                         sketch from breaking when bad function was provided and\n                         allows you to fix it and reload it on fly. You can\n                         disable this behaviour by enabling `:no-safe-fns`\n                         feature. Not supported in clojurescript.\n    - `:present`       - Switch to present mode (fullscreen without borders, OS\n                         panels). You may want to use this feature together with\n                         `:size :fullscreen`. Not supported in ClojureScript. In\n                         ClojureScript fullscreen is enabled by pressing F11 and\n                         it's enabled on all sketches automatically.\n    - `:no-start`      - Disables autostart if sketch was created using defsketch\n                         macro. To start sketch you have to call function created\n                         defsketch. Supported only in ClojureScript.\n                        Usage example: `:features [:keep-on-top :present]`\n  * `:bgcolor`        - Sets background color for unused space in present mode.\n                        Color is specified in hex format for example\n                        `:bgcolor \\\"#00FFFF\\\"` (cyan background)\n                        Not supported in ClojureScript.\n  * `:display`        - Sets what display should be used by this sketch.\n                        Displays are numbered starting from 0. Example: `:display 1`.\n                        Not supported in ClojureScript.\n  * `:setup`          - A function to be called once when setting the sketch up.\n  * `:draw`           - A function to be repeatedly called at most n times per\n                        second where n is the target [[frame-rate]] set for\n                        the visualisation.\n  * `:host`           - String id of canvas element or DOM element itself.\n                        Specifies host for the sketch. Must be specified in sketch,\n                        may be omitted in defsketch. If omitted in defsketch,\n                        :host is set to the name of the sketch. If element with\n                        specified id is not found on the page and page is empty -\n                        new canvas element will be created. Used in ClojureScript.\n  * `:focus-gained`   - Called when the sketch gains focus.\n                        Not supported in ClojureScript.\n  * `:focus-lost`     - Called when the sketch loses focus.\n                        Not supported in ClojureScript.\n  * `:mouse-entered`  - Called when the mouse enters the sketch window.\n  * `:mouse-exited`   - Called when the mouse leaves the sketch window\n  * `:mouse-pressed`  - Called every time a mouse button is pressed.\n  * `:mouse-released` - Called every time a mouse button is released.\n  * `:mouse-clicked`  - Called once after a mouse button has been pressed\n                        and then released.\n  * `:mouse-moved`    - Called every time the mouse moves and a button is\n                        not pressed.\n  * `:mouse-dragged`  - Called every time the mouse moves and a button is\n                        pressed.\n  * `:mouse-wheel`    - Called every time mouse wheel is rotated.\n                        Takes 1 argument - wheel rotation, an int.\n                        Negative values if the mouse wheel was rotated\n                        up/away from the user, and positive values\n                        if the mouse wheel was rotated down/ towards the user\n  * `:key-pressed`    - Called every time any key is pressed.\n  * `:key-released`   - Called every time any key is released.\n  * `:key-typed`      - Called once every time non-modifier keys are\n                        pressed.\n  * `:on-close`       - Called once, when sketch is closed.\n                        Not supported in ClojureScript.\n  * `:middleware`     - Vector of middleware to be applied to the sketch.\n                        Middleware will be applied in the same order as in comp\n                        function: [f g] will be applied as `(f (g options))`.\n  * `:settings`       - Cousin of `:setup`. A function to be called once when\n                        setting sketch up. Should be used only for [[smooth]] and\n                        [[no-smooth]].
